** About

I use [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard][Dvorak]] as my global system layout, but as Emacs input methods are
intended to be used with the QWERTY layout, I made this package with
some additional input methods that may be used with the Dvorak layout.
See [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WritingRussianWithDvorak][EmacsWiki: Writing Russian With Dvorak]] for a more detailed
description of this problem.

Files from this package are based on
[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/cyrillic-dvorak.el]].  Many thanks
to its author kirill.

If you want to see some other input methods in this package, contact me
and I will gladly add the new ones.

** Installation and Usage

*** Automatic

If you find this package useful, you may install it using [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][Quelpa]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(dvorak-layouts :fetcher github :repo "alezost/dvorak-layouts.el"))
#+END_SRC

After that =M-x dvorak-â€¦= commands for switching an input method will
become available, so you may bind those commands to keys and use them
without adding anything other things in your emacs config file.  If you
prefer to use =toggle-input-method= (it is bound to =C-\= by default),
you have to require a package with an input method you need.

*** Manual

Clone the repo and add the directory to =load-path=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dvorak-layouts")
#+END_SRC

Now you can either add autoloads to the commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(autoload 'dvorak-qwerty "dvorak-qwerty" nil t)
(autoload 'dvorak-russian-computer "dvorak-russian-computer" nil t)
#+END_SRC

or require a package you need:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'dvorak-russian-computer nil t)
#+END_SRC
